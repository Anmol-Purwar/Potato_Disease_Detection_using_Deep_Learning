# Potato_Disease_Detection_using_Deep_Learning
This project aims to develop an efficient Potato Disease Detection system using Deep Learning techniques. The application will involve training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a comprehensive dataset of potato plant images exhibiting various disease symptoms. The scope includes data collection, preprocessing, and augmentation, followed by model architecture selection and training. The project will involve the integration of the trained model into a user-friendly application. The application will allow users, such as farmers and agronomists, to upload images of their potato plants. The deep learning model will then analyze these images and classify the plants as healthy or affected by a specific disease. The system will provide timely and accurate insights, helping users make informed decisions about disease management and treatment
